# Rotten Tomatoes

THROW TOMATOES AT THINGS YOU <cr>HATE</cr>!!!

Default keybind is alt+t, and it will throw at your mouse position. (can be edited in custom keybinds).
If you hold it in you can rapid fire throw. Great for using on map-packs!

## Cool new settings
Update 1.0.2 introduced <cy>custom tomato support!</c> Go to the mod settings to customize tomato images.
